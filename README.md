# News Summary challenge

## Thoughts

Although was unable to finish the app, I understood how to apply mocking/doubles in the test framework. I used my own Guardian API, however for some reason it did not work, although tests are all passing. If I had more time, I would have dug deeper into fixing this issue and also add images and summary of each article.
